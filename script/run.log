INFO:root:> Good location away from the crouds Pleasant 10 min walk along the sea front to the Water Bus. restaurants etc. Hotel was comfortable breakfast was good - quite a variety. Room aircon didn't work very well. Take mosquito repelant!
INFO:root:> Great hotel with Jacuzzi bath! Really lovely hotel. Stayed on the very top floor and were surprised by a Jacuzzi bath we didn't know we were getting! Staff were friendly and helpful and the included breakfast was great! Great location and great value for money. Didn't want to leave!
INFO:root:> Good location on the Lido. We stayed here for four nights in October. The hotel staff were welcoming, friendly and helpful. Assisted in booking tickets for the opera. The rooms were clean and comfortable- good shower, light and airy rooms with windows you could open wide. Beds were comfortable. Plenty of choice for breakfast.Spa at hotel nearby which we used while we were there.
INFO:root:> Very nice hotel We loved staying on the island of Lido! You need to take a water is from Venice to get there. From the train station, a boat ride takes 45 minutes but has beautiful views along the way. Hotel is an EASY walk from the boat dock. The room was very clean and the breakfast was plentiful. We would definitely recommend this hotel!
INFO:root:> Lovely view out onto the lagoon. Excellent view. Lovely view out onto the lagoon. Excellent view. Staff were welcoming and helpful.
INFO:root:> Lovely view out onto the lagoon. Excellent view. ottimo soggiorno e ottima sistemazione nei giorni frenetici di inaugurazione della Biennale. Le signore alla reception sono efficientissime e squisite e non sono da meno le ragazze che servono la prima colazione. Da tornarci
INFO:root:> Ro og hygge Lidoen er perfekt til et par dages ro og afslapning, skn strand, lkkert omrde og lille hyggeligt familiehotel med et sdt personale
INFO:root:> It was ok hotel is nice from in and out but room It was ok hotel is nice from in and out but room was small we paid for double bed bat they atteched 2 single bed
INFO:root:> Sehr angenehmes Hotel ! Klasse Frhstck, freundliches und aufmerksames Personal, gute Anbindung nach Venedig, Zimmer vllig ok und sauber, Parkplatz in der Nhe gut verfgbar. Wrden wir wieder whlen!
INFO:root:> Tip top Bardzo sympatyczna obsuga, klimat hotelu. wietna azienka, widok na zatok. Bardzo dobry stosunek cena/jakosc. Polecam!
INFO:root:> Nice hotel with very friendly and helpful staff Nice hotel , with very friendly staff and helpful - great choice for breakfast , something for everyone.
INFO:root:> Hotellihuone oli pettymys Hotellihuone oli ullakolla, jossa ei pystynyt kvelemn suorassa. Huonekorkeus oli suurimmassa osassa n. 1,5m. Huoneestamme varastettiin rannekoru ja neuletakki. Lisksi Spa ei ollut hotellissa vaan n. kilometrin pss toisessa hotellissa. Laivalaiturilta oli kilometrin matka hotelliin. Lidon saari on kyll hyv majoituspaikka kun vierailee Venetsiassa, mutta en suosittele tt hotellia.
INFO:root:> Dungeons, Drain Flies and Centipedes DON'T stay here unless you're less than 2 feet tall or like sleeping with centipedes. Our 4th floor room was an attic with a vaulted ceiling that angles down to 3ft. The bed is only accessible from one side. If you placed your head in the skylight on the other side you might able sit up. The bathtub was impractical with broken shower head. We moved to the 1st floor the next day and within minutes found a centipede on the wall and15 flies. We asked for a broom to get rid of the centipede. Later in the day the receptionist said she gave us something to control the bugs. We never complained about the drain flies so she must have noticed a problem. That night we spent 2 hrs catching 6 centipedes in our room. 2 came from throw pillows. We asked reception for a new room or hotel but there supposedly weren't any hotels with open rooms and if we wanted leave we would have to pay for transportation and both hotels. The next morning we went to reception to tell them about the bug problem. We barely said anything before the woman apologized and said they didn't put the bugs in the room on purpose so we should just go about our day and forget it. She added that she often goes on vacation with her children and sometimes things happen, so she tries to make the best of everything and not start a war. Adding, a few euros isn't going to make anything go away so we should just go enjoy the day because more we talk the less time we have.
INFO:root:> Excellent hotel with good access to Venice We had absolutely no problems whatsoever with this hotel and were very pleasantly surprised by the quality considering the low price. The dcor of the room was pleasant and flawless, unlike many of the Venice hotels I've stayed in. The breakfast buffet was delicious too. And to finish all this off, the staff couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful. In terms of location, the hotel is about 10 minutes walk from the Lido waterbus stop, then a boat takes around 15 mins to get into Venice. We didn't find this a problem at all - we knew this was going to be the case so had pre-booked transport tickets to save money. The surrounding Lido is pleasant and worth an explore in a spare couple of hours. In conclusion, I would book this again due to the fantastic quality of the hotel, despite the trade-off of not being in Venice itself.
INFO:root:> Lovely stay - second time staying at this hotel. Lovely hotel, 10 min walk to the water bus stop on lido. Away from the madness of Venice, but close enough to be there in less than 20 minutes.
INFO:root:> A good Hotel on the Lido - Quiet location. Located on the Lido I would recommend this hotel if you require a little piece and quiet after the busy day's in Venice, facility's good, staff very friendly and very helpful. I requested flowers for the room as it was one of my wife's special birthday's, and yes they ordered exactly as requested, can't ask for more. Rooms are a little on the small side but in line with most European hotels of this standard so wasn't a surprise or a problem, room and bathroom was cleaned every day with fresh towels supplied each day. Buffet breakfast had various options to suit most peoples taste but It was a surprise to see sausage, bacon and scrambled eggs available, must have been put on to satisfy us Brits! We stayed during late September so the Lido is probably quieter at that time however we felt very safe walking around late at night back to the hotel but taxis are available if you feel a little vulnerable. Restaurants and coffee bars are located in the main commercial area close to the Waterbus stations and tend to be slightly cheaper than in Venice. We had a water taxi (think luxury speed boat!) from the airport to the hotel and back again, quite an experience, a little costly but well worth it, a lot quicker and less hassle than the Waterbus. Venice was very busy during the day time, St Marks Square at night is a must, fantastic atmosphere. All in all we had a great time in Venice, it can be a little expensive so don't ponder over the bills to much, just pay up with a smile!
INFO:root:> A good Hotel on the Lido - Quiet location. Mysigt med fina rum, bra frukost och nra bde till stranden och btterminalen.
INFO:root:> I would come back Great stay...close to ferry.food not so good nearby
INFO:root:> I would come back Stayed with parents, wife twin toddlers in two triple rooms. The hotel is easy to reach and the rooms were well placed well furnished. The best feature was extremely friendly helpful staff, particularly Ms. Annalucia Ms. Anna who were always ready to listen help out with big smiles. The breakfasts were very good, with good spread and the guests were made welcome to sit and eat at leisure (more important when you are with toddlers!) Would surely go back to Venice would happily stay again at Russo Palace.
INFO:root:> Excellent Service This hotel is in Lido which is a better choice than staying in crowded Venice. The water bus is very convenient and it takes only few more stops to the main attractions in Venice. We received excellent service - many thanks to Anna and Donnatella who made us feel at home.
INFO:root:> stayed before and after cruise It was a 10 min+ walk to water bus, would have liked it closer. Located on the water on Lido island, away from the rush of Venice
INFO:root:> Good for one night Room was tiny-bed saggy-bAthroom door didn't work. Good breakfast and convenient location. Wouldn't return or recommend.
INFO:root:> Best Front Desk Receptionist EVER!! VERY FRIENDLY AND HELPFUL WITH DIRECTIONS, KNOWING ALL THE RIGHT PLACES TO VISIT AND WHERE TO EAT TH BEST FOOD IN THE AREA. The Front Desk Receptionists were extremely helpful ..especially Sabrina who made us feel very welcomed to Lido....We will be back next year for sure!
INFO:root:> ;-) No shower but jets in the bathtub and my room was slanted but made it work
INFO:root:> ;-) Hotel sympathique et silencieux sur l ile du Lido a quelques minutes en vaporetto de Venise. Personnels trs avenants et parlants plusieurs langues, dont le franais. Voyage dpaysant et inoubliable... aucune voiture l horyzon
INFO:root:> Nice Hotel on the quiet part of Lido Really enjoyed the stay, about a 10min walk to the main waterbus station. Had the perfect quiet location and staff were really friendly!!
INFO:root:> Bra til rabattert pris Nyrenovert bad hevet opplevelsen.
INFO:root:> Gezellig hotel Prima uitval basis voor stedentrip. Rustige buurt
INFO:root:> Gezellig hotel Walls extremely thin, you can hear everything. Excessive hoovering every morning outside bedroom. There. Is a bar, but no one to tend it.
INFO:root:> Good option, great staff, quiet neighborhood If you're looking for a hotel where the action is, go elsewhere. The hotel is on the Lido, which is about a 10-15 minute waterbus ride away from Venice. However, if you're looking for a place on the Lido, this is a well-priced option. The staff was great with handling/recommending dinner reservations, even during an insane Carnevale weekend. The doors are a little thin and since the building is old, the soundproofing needs improvement. The quarters are cramped, but the room comes with breakfast. If we wanted to stay on the Lido again, this would be a good option, but next time I think we'll opt for a place closer to the action. Recommended.
INFO:root:> Decent Hotel on Lido Hotel facilities are good and breakfast ample. Econmy rooms have sloping roof so tall guests mind your head We stayed in one and it was fine, the occational bump but for the price you cant really complain.
INFO:root:> Very pleasant. Friendly reception very helpful. Hotel has pleasant views and is about ten minute walk to main water bus terminal to take you any direction. We used the spa one day. Good saunas but relaxation area noisy and small. Some lovely restaurants close by and cheaper than in Venice.
INFO:root:> Nice It was a bit far from city center
INFO:root:> Clean hotel with amazing staff Great hotel, staff where amazing and the location and views make this a great Base to visit Venice!
INFO:root:> Nice hotel Close to Venice and decent hotel, breakfast was okay with no too much selection but has everything you need.
INFO:root:> Nice hotel beautiful views of Venice in the lovely relaxed calmer area of Lido Di Venezia. Gorgeous sunsets and very easy to access Venice, rather than satying in the hustle and bustle. Close to only beaches in Venice. Staff were so helpful, especially Ivan and the lady we met on the desk each morning.
INFO:root:> Great view This is a great little hotel. We had a wonderful view from the room and patio. Good size. Breakfast was great even had North American breakfast foods. Only issue was the two twin beds pushed together. That was very uncomfortable.
INFO:root:> Good pleasant pick Nice staff. Nice location. We booked two nights at Russo hotel on Lido strip and two nights in the very center of Venice. This is a good balance. Lido is a bit further but it feels more local and is more relaxing too, it gave us a taste of Dolce Vita. We didn't see it on the hotel description but they offered us a taxi boat ride to Murano with another couple for free. The boat ride was very pleasant, they dropped us in a glass blowing factory shop, the glass making demonstration was nice and there was very little pressure to buy. Internet was free for 20 minutes/day but a bit slow like everywhere in Venice. So in short a good pick, good value for money.
INFO:root:> Nice hotel, good location. Nice and clean. Rooms are spacious with air conditioning. Good selection of breakfast. Within easy reach of San Marco. Quite location.
INFO:root:> nan
INFO:root:> Hospitality at its Best! We had a wonderful, relaxing time. The staff were completely attentive and accommodating. We had a corner king room with a kitchen, two patios and a deluxe bathroom. You had to drive into town but they said that Uber is available if you need it. This was our first visit to Palm Springs and hopefully not our last! It really... More
INFO:root:> Pure delight! We were in Palm Springs on the day the temperature was 123 degrees! Despite that, we had a wonderful stay because of the Little Paradise hotel. The staff were friendly and accommodating, and all of the little complimentary touches were so nice, like a bottle of wine for us in the fridge, sun care products near the pool, and a... More
INFO:root:> Awesome! Quiet secluded tranquility We arrived in Palm Springs not sure what to expect....it's a quiet kinda place in 'low season'....we drove down what appeared to be a residential street...parked up at a wooden gate and weren't sure what to expect. What awaited took us back in amazement...the room is spacious with an air of decadence...the welcome wine and comprehensive breakfast was more than... More
INFO:root:> As the title suggests.... This place really is a little paradise!! A beautiful boutique style hotel with EVERYTHING meticulously thought out to make our vacation perfect. Saltwater pool, fresh fruit, BEST showerhead I've ever experienced, I can go on and on. The bed was so comfortable and we slept like babies. Victor did a wonderful job and Judy was just lovely and personable!
INFO:root:> Loved this Wonderful Boutique Hotel! Spent 3 nights at Little Paradise boutique hotel on a mother-daughter trip. Wonderful and relaxing experience. Clean and newly redone rooms that are well equipped and spacious. Perfect location off the main street in a quiet neighborhood that is close to downtown Palm Springs. The pool area has a nice gas fire pit area and lots of comfy chaise lounges... More
INFO:root:> Lovely place to stay This little hotel surpassed all my expectations. The rooms are well equiped with a little kitchenette, fridge was filled with croissants, 3 bottles of water, soda and much more. The room was very clean and the bathroom was equiped with a top notch shower. I would definately recommend this place to anyone visiting or passing trough Palm Springs. The reception... More
INFO:root:> Appropriately Named Hotel If you want peaceful and relaxing look no further. Although set up like a single floor motel it is hardly anything but. The rooms are very nice with a full kitchen. They provide some breakfast items, snacks and bottles of spring water. You can bring in anything you like to enjoy at the pool or in your room. By the... More
INFO:root:> Just what we needed! All the reviews are great and agree on this fine little place. I'd also like to add the wonderful service you will find here with Victor and staff who seem to want to do anything and everything to make you happy. The king beds here are just amazing. We seldom run into beds this comfy. The room has a large... More
INFO:root:> Really nice room, really nice view, quiet court area of town away from the strip We went for a relaxing weekend as an offshoot of a family visit. This was a great place to go with a nice room and a view of the mountains from just outside. The ONLY thing we didn't like was that the sun dropped below the mountains too early and the temperature dropped along with it. Maybe you can fix... More
INFO:root:> AN OUTPOST OF ELEGANCE AND RELAXATION We were on a business trip to Anaheim and, afterwards, drove to Palm Springs for a relaxing weekend. It turned out that this hotel was the perfect place! We arrived late and were pleasantly surprised upon checking in to see that, not only were the accommodations incredibly thoughtful and comfortable, but the refrigerator came stocked with croissants, bagels, cream cheese,... More
INFO:root:> Very accommodating Victor and Judy were truly accommodating hosts, especially when we had to cut our stay short due to illness. Everything that has been written by other reviewers was spot on. It is more like a small inn or bed breakfast (with the breakfast left in the fridge in your room) than a hotel. There are eight guest rooms around... More
INFO:root:> Suuuuper relaxing peaceful If you want to relax, want a quiet atmosphere, cozy setting.. this is the place. It is definitely a smaller, boutique-type hotel and it feels that way. So that's good for some and maybe not as much for others. The room is great, very pretty. Very impressive large, new Curved HD TV. So that's nice! The small kitchen is also... More
INFO:root:> Perfect Stayed 5 nights and it was delightful. Lovely comfortable,well lit, great shower and bathroom,kitchen with microwave,fridge etc and very functional room. Ten hotels on this trip but this one seems to have thought of everything. Peaceful yet near the main streets with lovely shopping, art and some great restaurants. Good local transport but downtown is walkable but a bit over... More
INFO:root:> A perfect gem New everything would be great from the moment we came through the gate. Nine excellent, high quality rooms each with a small kitchen/diner and terrific shower room including twin wash basins. Each room faces onto the pool with plenty of sun loungers, towels, shaded areas and comfortable seating. Rooms furnished to extremely high standard and beds have the finest linen... More
INFO:root:> As the name says Spend four days there and would have prolonged our stay if they only had a room available. Welcoming host, all rooms around the patio / pool. This place breathes tranquility and relaxation. Since you normally travel by car in this country anyways, everything is close by.
INFO:root:> It is no surprise this is so high on trip advisor. Service, location and setting! I'm going to keep this fairly short but what I will say is if you are going to stay in Palm Springs please stay here. It's not right on the main drag but it's in a lovely residential area, no noise, ample parking and just so peaceful. Only 5 in an Uber to the main strip with the bars and... More
INFO:root:> Very nice boutique hotel We had unit 4 on the east side of the complex for 3 nights - very quiet, very comfortable bed, nice amenities in room - killer shower!! pool was large, heated, wonderful - Judy hope I got that right made us fresh orange and banana smoothies when we were in the pool - breakfast in fridge was just ok, little...

Big comfortable bed, nice kitchen with granite countertops, fridge, Keurig coffee maker, and even a two burner stove. Bathrooms are big with granite countertops, two sinks, and a huge shower. Pool area is gorgeous and the owner and staff make you feel... More
INFO:root:> Lovely oasis of rest This place is just perfect for everyone looking for some rest in lovely and warm Palm Springs. The host welcomed us very very friendly, explaining us what we could find where. The private kitchen had our breakfast and a complimentary bottle of wine. The room (call it the appartment) had everything and was very well decorated and had an outside... More
INFO:root:> Lovely oasis of rest to share your opinion of this businesswith YP visitors across the United Statesand in your neighborhood
INFO:root:> Hotel, Motel or BB Either way a very nice stay Little Paradise is called a hotel, but it is more of a motel tucked away in a nice neighborhood district with similar styled single story boutique motels/hotels. This is not your large chain full service hotel but a nice hideaway with just a few rooms surrounding a warm salt water swimming pool. There is no on-site restaurant but you get... More
INFO:root:> Home away from home If you are being treated at any Texas Medical Center facility this is a good place to stay. Very clean, decent breakfast, and shuttle. The only negative is that the shuttle doesn't run in the middle of the day making it inconvenient to return to the hotel following an appointment. We have had to take a taxi a few times.... More
INFO:root:> Discriminatory Pathetic and discriminatory. They have a free shuttle service, but it is not accessible to wheelchair users, and they don't care. The front desk did not do anything about the issue. I emailed the corporate customer care email address and they take unreasonable amounts of time to respond to emails and do not remedy the problem. The customer care email... More
INFO:root:> Great place to stay in Houston This Comfort Suites was a terrific hotel. The staff was friendly and the room was clean and a good size. There was great food for breakfast and a large variety. It was very convenient for our trip. We went to an Astros game and the drive was about 18 minutes. We went to the Johnson Space Center the next day... More
INFO:root:> walking distance to NRG Stadium Great location walking distance to NRG Stadium. Next door to Pappa BBQ (warning- good, but very smoky flavor). Hotel was nicely decorated, gave a warm welcome. Front desk staff was friendly, though distracted. Our room, while quite large (we had an accessible room), had two ACs that did not de-humidify the room. It felt damp/humid the whole stay. Though... More
INFO:root:> Bad dogs with small TV!!!!!!!!!!! The room was clean, the hotel workers were very good and the breakfast was also good. But the kennel with the dogs was awful. These dogs starting barking at six in the morning. The television in my room was a twenty inch LG. I will never go back there again.
INFO:root:> Nearest to NRG Stadium! Only .3 (three tenths!) of a mile away from the Kirby St. gate of NRG Stadium. It can even be considered walking distance, and you avoid the price of parking! How nice it is to be so nearby after attending an exciting event at NRG Stadium.....saving the possibly long drive home, or to the airport, for the next day.
INFO:root:> This hotel was much improved on our May 8, 2016 On our two trips prior to this one both the breakfast and the internet were below par. I am glad to report that on our most recent trip the internet worked great and the breakfast was much improved. When you go to Texas for cancer treatment, the little things become big things. You can stay here with confidence.
INFO:root:> Highly recommend Stayed here for two nights to visit MDA. The rooms are clean. The bed is comfortable. The internet worked great. The staff was nice. Close to many restaurants. I highly recommend. We stayed at Best Western the last visit and had a total different (bad) experience.
INFO:root:> Great hotel especially for medical visit I was a bit concerned after checking the rating of this hotel, but was so pleasantly surprised when I got there. I was basically there for a medical visit and it seemed like so were a lot of other people, but we would totally stay there if we were just visiting Houston. My mom checked in for me since I... More
INFO:root:> Best place to stay for medical center area. We stay here each time my husband has a medical appt in Houston and they do offer medical rates if you ask. It is near medical center off of Main St. Very quiet and very clean large rooms. Several eating places within walking distance. Offers medical center shuttle also. The pool is very small, but we don't use that anyways... More
INFO:root:> Horrible experience Visited the comfort suites in new iberia louisiana and my daughters head was almost decapitated in the elivator. When i talked to the front desk to make a complaint and get the front desk to give me the corporate information she gave me a cell phone number instead of the corporate office . We called numerous times before an answer... More
INFO:root:> Great place and accommodating staff I have been staying here, off and on, four about 7 years. The first time was when my father was going thru treatment at MD Anderson. The staff were great, made accommodations for him and also for his caregivers. They were also very understanding for those going thru treatments also local hospitals. I have also stayed there during my pre... More
INFO:root:> Well maintained Very nice, like new lobby and rooms. Lobby and halls have tile floors that look great. Fancy, large chandelier in lobby. Hotel is 13 years old but looked like it was remodeled recently. Near Rice University. Had a security guard on duty. Fridge in our room was noisy. Dual phone charger ports by bed and on desk. Lots of digital... More
INFO:root:> Nice The hotel was great, staff was great only bad thing was the breakfast as I am a choice hotel guy and most of the comfort suites have a great breakfast this one kinda lacked. But Staff and rest of the hotel was great
INFO:root:> Medical Emergency We stayed here because of a family medical emergency.Did not have any options for a room. We had the SMALL queen room--think it may have been laundry area previously. Bed fair. Room quite. Was OK for one night. This hotel is near the stadium. Price was ok .99 plus tax.
INFO:root:> Nice rooms! The room was fine and the mattress was very comfortable. Unfortunately, I arrived while the front entrance was under-construction. There was not sufficient signage to find out how to enter the building. I would have left, had I not already had a reservation through Hotels.com.
INFO:root:> Dirty Room Reprehensible three days without maid service despite telling the management after it had happened the first time. I would not recommend this hotel for this reason.
INFO:root:> Not that happy The pictures on the web site were more expensive looking then the reality. We were told we had one of the best rooms, besides staring at cargo containers, the TV would not work so they changed our room. It was not well furnished and we could not regulate the air conditioner (way too warm for sleeping). The continental breakfast was good and the staff was very nice and helpful. The linens were harsh and uncomfortable. Sorry, but this was not at all what I expected and it was certainly unacceptable.
INFO:root:> Not that happy The didn't tell me they were gonna run my credit card for accidental for a 100 charge. They just told me they had to double check my ID and the credit card that was used.
INFO:root:> Wine! I stayed here with some girlfriends for a wine tasting getaway. The staff pointed out some great wineries and restaurants and were very friendly.
INFO:root:> Just Lovely Beautiful hotel. Very clean and service was great. This is a must stay and if I'm in need of a hotel in the Livermore area, this is the place to stay.
INFO:root:Finishing
